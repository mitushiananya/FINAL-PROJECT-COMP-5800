# FINAL-PROJECT-COMP-5800

There are three folders under the main folder ‘FINAL_PROJECT_COMP5800’. The data is in each of these three folders under the ‘data’ folder. The three folders are:
1. Final Project Aspect J
2. Final Project SWT
3. Final Project ZXing

And each of these three folders have two runnable JupyterNotebooks, the name of the files are:
1. final_project_AspectJ.ipynb
2. final_project_aspectj_withoutfixed.ipynb
3. final_project_swt.ipynb
4. final_project_SWT_withoutfixed.ipynb
5. final_project_zxing.ipynb
6. final_project_zxing_withoutfixed.ipynb

The notebooks are already executed with the last kernel’s output saved. 
Instruction manual on how to run:
1. Install python 3.8 +.
2. Also, download and install the spaCy's “en_core_web_lg” pretrained model and NLTK data. From NLTK, punkt and averaged_perceptron_tagger are needed that can be downloaded using NLTK Downloader GUI or a Python interpreter:
            >>> import nltk
            >>> nltk.download('punkt')
            >>> nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
3. The datasets are under the data folder (in all the three folders). 
4. Just change the location under the variables “_DATASET_ROOT” and “RESULTS_ROOT” in the second code block of all the six Jupyter notebooks. 
5. There are six Jupyter Notebooks in total with the code blocks executed. The last code block gives the ultimate final result and it has been already run and executed for saving your time. 
6. The following are the requirements for the code: inflection, javalang, nltk, numpy, pygments, scikit-learn, scipy, spacy and xmltodict.
